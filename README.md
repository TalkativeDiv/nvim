# Abhi's nvim config

> A batteries-included yet minimal neovim config.

It uses:
- `lazy.nvim` for a easy to extend, widely supported package managing experience
- `blink-cmp` for simple and speedy snippets
- `lspconfig and treesitter` for ease of use and native integration
- `mason` for easy enviorment recreation for language servers
- `noice` for nice pop ups that feel snappy
- `snacks-nvim` for simple, integrated plugins for miscellaneous needs
- `telescope with fzf-native` for fast and widely supported fuzzy searching
- `none-ls` for advanced formatting and linting with support for use within code actions
- `oil.nvim` for efficient file editing, similar to editing in a buffer (use telescope for file navigation)
